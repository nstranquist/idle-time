### Idle Time

Idle Time makes it possible for the average human to use the powerful Timeblocking technique in their daily lives!

Life isn't perfect, so why does your planning have to be perfect as well?
If you plan 1 hour for a meeting, but it goes 5 minutes longer than planned, what do you do?
Maybe this can happen once or twice in a day without causing much trouble, but what happens when your schedule is thrown off several times? You either waste time updating your schedule, or forego the schedule and go back to remembering it all in your head!!
With Idle Time, you can click the "Play" button and all of your time blocks will be re-aligned to start at the current time.

There are many, many more features in this app!  

Features:
- Drag n Drop time blocks
- Expand / Collapsed view for timeblocks
- Save blocks as preset, and customize as you'd like
- Set the priority of timeblocks with different color codes
- Track the hours you've worked
- Set the start and end times for your work day, along with the total time you want to work, and Idle Time will take care of the rest to keep you on track!
